This project is a fork from the [Discord Music Bot](https://github.com/SudhanPlayz/Discord-MusicBot/) project originally created by [SudhanPlayz](https://github.com/SudhanPlayz/). It's almost unfair to call it a fork because most of the code is mostly untouched. However, modifications have been made and some "bulk" was trimmed from the original library. The AbstractGuild server is very grateful for Sudhan's project and we highly encourage you to check out his repo.
